**Initial Release of the Hyperlane Cosmos SDK Module** 🚀

This module integrates the **Hyperlane messaging protocol** 
([Hyperlane Docs](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/)), enabling seamless interchain 
communication. It also provides full support for **token bridges**, 
secured by **multi-signature Interchain Security Modules**.

### **Key Features**
- **Mailbox Functionality** – Send and receive messages securely across chains.
- **Warp Routes (Token Bridging)**
  - **Collateral Tokens** – Native asset bridging.
  - **Synthetic Tokens** – Wrapped asset representation.
  - **TokenRouter** – Manages token flows across chains.
  - **GasRouter**
- **Interchain Security Modules (ISMs)**
  - **Merkle-Root-Multisig-ISM** – Secure verification using Merkle roots.
  - **MessageId-Multisig-ISM** – Ensures integrity with message ID-based validation.
- **Post Dispatch Hooks**
  - **Merkle Tree Hook** – Supports Merkle-based verification for Multisig ISMs.
  - **InterchainGasPaymaster** – Provides gas prices for destination chains and interchain gas payments.

The module includes a comprehensive test suite and a preconfigured minimal 
Cosmos SDK app.
